import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

The TCGdx API provides comprehensive pricing data for Pok√©mon cards, sourced directly from the world's largest trading card marketplaces. Access current market values, historical trends, and variant-specific pricing.

## What is Market Pricing Data?

Our pricing system aggregates market data from major trading platforms to provide accurate, up-to-date valuations for every Pok√©mon card in your applications.

Key features include:

- **Real-time pricing**: Updated hourly (TCGPlayer) to daily (Cardmarket) across all major marketplaces
- **Multiple variants**: Separate pricing for differents variants (depends on provider)
- **Historical trends**: Track price movements over 1, 7, and 30-day periods (depend on provider)
- **Global coverage**: Data from Europe's Cardmarket and North America's TCGplayer
- **Embedded data**: Pricing included directly in card responses - no separate endpoints

## Available Marketplaces

Our API covers the two largest Pok√©mon card marketplaces globally:

### üè© Cardmarket (Europe)
- **Currency**: EUR
- **Coverage**: Europe's largest TCG marketplace
- **Update frequency**: Daily
- **Data points**: Current averages, trends, lows, and 7/30-day historical data
- **Variants**: Standard and holo-specific pricing

### üè¶ TCGplayer (North America)
- **Currency**: USD
- **Coverage**: Leading North American platform
- **Update frequency**: Hourly to daily
- **Data points**: Low, mid, high, market, and direct pricing
- **Variants**: Normal, reverse holo, and holo variants

## Getting Started

Pricing data is automatically included in every card response under the `pricing` field. No additional setup or endpoints required.

<Aside type="caution">
	If the card is not listed on a marketplace, the provider will be omitted.
</Aside>

### Quick Start Examples

<Card title="REST API">
```http
GET https://api.tcgdx.dev/v2/en/cards/swsh3-136
```

The response includes pricing data directly in the card object:
```json
{
  "id": "swsh3-136",
  "name": "Charizard",
  "pricing": {
    "cardmarket": { /* EUR pricing */ },
    "tcgplayer": { /* USD pricing */ }
  }
}
```
</Card>

<Card title="SDK Integration">
```typescript
import TCGdx from '@tcgdx/sdk'

const sdk = new TCGdx('en')
const card = await sdk.cards.get('swsh3-136')

// Access Cardmarket pricing (EUR)
console.log(card.pricing.cardmarket.trend)
console.log(card.pricing.cardmarket.avg30)

// Access TCGplayer pricing (USD)
console.log(card.pricing.tcgplayer.holo.marketPrice)
console.log(card.pricing.tcgplayer.normal.lowPrice)
```
</Card>
