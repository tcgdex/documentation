import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

When you try to get an image from the API you might mostly get an url ending without any extension like below.

```url
https://assets.tcgdex.net/en/swsh/swsh3/136
```

**That's normal.**

We allows you to customise the extension and quality _(for Cards)_ of the image you want.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Cards">
		For `cards` the url can be reconstructed as such

		```bash
		https://assets.tcgdex.net/en/swsh/swsh3/136/{quality}.{extension}
		```

		with `{quality}` being replaced by `high` or `low`

		and `{extension}` being replaced by `png`, `webp` or `jpg`

		_[see details below](#extension)_
	</TabItem>

	<TabItem label="Symbols/Logos">
		for `symbols` and `logos` the url can be reconstructed as such

		```bash
		https://assets.tcgdex.net/en/swsh/swsh3/symbol.{extension}
		```

		with `{extension}` being replaced by `png`, `webp` or `jpg`

		_[see details below](#extension)_
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-----------

Some of the SDKs have helpers to easily reconstruct them

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Kotlin">
		on a `Card` object

		```kotlin
			// get the final url
			val url = card.getImageUrl("high", "webp")
			// you can even get the image directly
			val image = card.getImage("high", "webp")
		```
		on a `Set` object

		```kotlin
			// get the final url
			val symbolURL = set.getSymbolUrl("webp")
			// get the symbol image buffer directly
			val symbol = set.getSymbol("webp")

			// get the final url
			val logoURL = set.getLogoUrl("webp")
			// get the logo image buffer directly
			val logo = set.getLogo("webp")
		```
	</TabItem>

	<TabItem label="Java">
		on a `Card` object

		```java
			// get the final url
			String url = card.getImageUrl("high", "webp")
			// you can even get the image directly
			BufferedImage image = card.getImage("high", "webp")
		```
		on a `Set` object

		```java
			// get the final url
			String symbolURL = set.getSymbolUrl("webp")
			// get the symbol image buffer directly
			BufferedImage symbol = set.getSymbol("webp")

			// get the final url
			String logoURL = set.getLogoUrl("webp")
			// get the logo image buffer directly
			BufferedImage logo = set.getLogo("webp")
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Extension

Every assets are available with three extensions :
- `png`: card with Transparent background
- `jpg`: card with Black background **(not Recommanded)**
- `webp`: Modern format that is more compact than png/jpg with a transparent background **(Recommanded)**

<Aside type="tip">

When displaying your image on the web it is highly recommanded o display a `webp` image

for other formats, the `png` should be used as won't lose the transparent background

</Aside>

## Quality

Every assets are available with three extensions :
- `high`: get the image in a 600x825 format
- `low`: get the image in a 245x337 format

<Aside type="tip">

When you want to display a lot of images that are not big, use `low`

When the image is the main attraction, use `high`
