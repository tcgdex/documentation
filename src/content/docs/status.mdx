## API Progress

The TCGdex API aims to make every Pok√©mon TCG card available in all languages they were officially released in. Our real-time status tracker below shows our current translation progress across the entire database.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <img src="https://api.tcgdex.net/status/github.svg" alt="TCGdex API Translation Status" style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" />
</div>

This chart displays the percentage of cards with complete data in each supported language. Our database includes many languages with varying completion levels:

- **English, French, Spanish, German, Italian**: Widely available languages
- **Japanese, Portuguese, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified)**: Asian and additional European languages
- **Thai, Indonesian, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Korean**: Additional supported languages

Completion levels vary depending on official card releases in each language and available translation resources.

You can get the full details directly in the API through https://api.tcgdex.net/status

  **Want to help with translations?**

  You can contribute by adding translations to card objects that currently have data in at least one language. Additional translation files are located in the `meta/translations` directory of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tcgdex/cards-database).
