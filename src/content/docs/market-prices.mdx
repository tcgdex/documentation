The TCGdx API provides comprehensive real-time pricing data for Pok√©mon cards, sourced directly from the world's largest trading card marketplaces. Access current market values, historical trends, and variant-specific pricing with zero configuration.

## What is Market Pricing Data?

Our pricing system aggregates live market data from major trading platforms to provide accurate, up-to-date valuations for every Pok√©mon card in your applications. This data powers collection managers, deck builders, inventory systems, and marketplace tools worldwide.

Key features include:

- **Real-time pricing**: Updated hourly to daily across all major marketplaces
- **Multiple variants**: Separate pricing for normal, reverse holo, and holo cards
- **Historical trends**: Track price movements over 1, 7, and 30-day periods
- **Global coverage**: Data from Europe's Cardmarket and North America's TCGplayer
- **Zero setup**: No API keys, authentication, or special configuration required
- **Embedded data**: Pricing included directly in card responses - no separate endpoints

## Available Marketplaces

Our API covers the two largest Pok√©mon card marketplaces globally:

### üè© Cardmarket (Europe)
- **Currency**: EUR
- **Coverage**: Europe's largest TCG marketplace
- **Update frequency**: Daily
- **Data points**: Current averages, trends, lows, and 7/30-day historical data
- **Variants**: Standard and holo-specific pricing

### üè¶ TCGplayer (North America)
- **Currency**: USD
- **Coverage**: Leading North American platform
- **Update frequency**: Hourly to daily
- **Data points**: Low, mid, high, market, and direct pricing
- **Variants**: Normal, reverse holo, and holo variants

## Getting Started

Pricing data is automatically included in every card response under the `pricing` field. No additional setup or endpoints required.

### Quick Start Examples

<Card title="REST API">
```http
GET https://api.tcgdx.dev/v2/en/cards/swsh3-136
```

The response includes pricing data directly in the card object:
```json
{
  "id": "swsh3-136",
  "name": "Charizard",
  "pricing": {
    "cardmarket": { /* EUR pricing */ },
    "tcgplayer": { /* USD pricing */ }
  }
}
```
</Card>

<Card title="SDK Integration">
```typescript
import TCGdx from '@tcgdx/sdk'

const sdk = new TCGdx('en')
const card = await sdk.cards.get('swsh3-136')

// Access Cardmarket pricing (EUR)
console.log(card.pricing.cardmarket.trend)
console.log(card.pricing.cardmarket.avg30)

// Access TCGplayer pricing (USD)
console.log(card.pricing.tcgplayer.holo.marketPrice)
console.log(card.pricing.tcgplayer.normal.lowPrice)
```
</Card>

## API Examples

### Complete Pricing Response

Here's what pricing data looks like in a typical card response:

```json
"pricing": {
  "cardmarket": {
    "unit": "EUR",
    "avg": 0.03,
    "low": 0.02,
    "trend": 0.04,
    "avg7": 0.04,
    "avg30": 0.03,
    "avg-holo": 0.24,
    "low-holo": 0.02,
    "trend-holo": 0.24
  },
  "tcgplayer": {
    "unit": "USD",
    "normal": {
      "lowPrice": 0.01,
      "midPrice": 0.10,
      "highPrice": 4.95,
      "marketPrice": 0.06,
      "directLowPrice": 0.02
    },
    "reverse": {
      "lowPrice": 0.05,
      "midPrice": 0.31,
      "highPrice": 4.95,
      "marketPrice": 0.32,
      "directLowPrice": 0.30
    },
    "holo": {
      "lowPrice": 0.20,
      "midPrice": 0.50,
      "highPrice": 6.00,
      "marketPrice": 0.45,
      "directLowPrice": 0.35
    }
  }
}
```

### Building Price Comparison Tools

```typescript
// Compare prices across marketplaces
const card = await sdk.cards.get("swsh3-136")
const pricing = card.pricing

// Convert EUR to USD for comparison (example rate: 1.1)
const eurToUsd = 1.1
const cardmarketUsd = pricing.cardmarket.trend * eurToUsd
const tcgplayerUsd = pricing.tcgplayer.normal.marketPrice

console.log(`Cardmarket: $${cardmarketUsd.toFixed(2)}`)
console.log(`TCGplayer: $${tcgplayerUsd.toFixed(2)}`)
```

## Integration Best Practices

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Caching Strategy">
    Cache pricing data appropriately based on update frequency:
    - Cardmarket: 24-hour cache recommended
    - TCGplayer: 1-6 hour cache recommended
  </Card>

  <Card title="Currency Handling">
    Remember to handle multiple currencies in your UI:
    - Display original currency when possible
    - Provide conversion rates for comparison
    - Consider user location for default currency
  </Card>

  <Card title="Variant Support">
    Not all cards have all variants:
    - Check for null/undefined values
    - Gracefully handle missing variant data
    - Consider fallback display options
  </Card>

  <Card title="Performance Tips">
    Optimize for your use case:
    - Batch card requests when possible
    - Use appropriate pagination
    - Consider server-side caching
  </Card>
